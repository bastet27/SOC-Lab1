### :green_book: Introduction  

I‚Äôm excited to embark on a journey to build a fully functional **SOC (Security Operations Center) Automation Lab**, following the guide outlined in this [write-up](https://medium.com/@jashankhaira52/day-1-building-your-soc-automation-lab-an-introduction-and-overview-c1825642369e). This project is an opportunity to gain hands-on experience with incident detection, response, and automation, using tools commonly found in SOC environments.  

My lab will be set up using the **AWS Free Tier**, which makes cloud-based solutions accessible and scalable without requiring expensive hardware. This approach allows me to focus on the critical elements of building, automating, and scaling SOC workflows.  

The lab will utilize several powerful tools:  
- **[Wazuh](https://documentation.wazuh.com/current/)**: A security information and event management (SIEM) platform for real-time threat detection.  
- **[The Hive](https://thehive-project.org/documentation/)**: A case management tool for tracking and resolving incidents.  
- **[Shuffle](https://shuffler.io/docs/)**: A security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) platform to automate incident workflows.  
- **[Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index.html)**: A log storage and retrieval solution.  
- **[Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/index.html)**: A visualization tool for analyzing and exploring log data.  

### üéØ Goals for the SOC Lab Project  
I plan to:  
- Set up a cloud-based SOC environment using AWS Free Tier.  
- Integrate Wazuh, The Hive, and Shuffle to detect and respond to threats.  
- Automate incident response workflows for efficiency and scalability.  
- Document the process to build a portfolio-ready project for showcasing my skills.  

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Why AWS Free Tier?  
Cloud-based labs are a game-changer for accessibility and scalability. With AWS Free Tier, I can:  
- Build and test my lab without high upfront costs.  
- Scale resources as my project grows.  
- Access my lab from anywhere with an internet connection.  

This SOC Automation Lab will help me gain real-world cybersecurity skills while laying the foundation for future growth and advanced integrations. Stay tuned as I document this exciting process and share my progress! üöÄ  

## Research and Getting Ready

### :green_book: Tasks Completed  

- **GitHub Account**: I already have a GitHub account set up, where I document my progress and share write-ups for my cybersecurity projects.  
- **Documentation Platform**: My GitHub serves as the primary platform for showcasing my work and skills to potential employers.  
- **Research**: Began researching the tools I‚Äôll use in this project by reviewing their official documentation.  

### :toolbox: Tools Overview

  Wazuh is an open-source SIEM and XDR platform that provides:  
  - Real-time threat detection and response.  
  - Log management and security analytics.  
  - Endpoint detection capabilities, ensuring comprehensive visibility into security events.  

- **[The Hive](https://thehive-project.org/documentation/)**  
  The Hive is an incident response and case management system designed to:  
  - Organize and track security incidents.  
  - Assign cases for investigation, making incident management more efficient.  
  - Provide integration with other tools like Wazuh and Shuffle for a cohesive workflow.  

- **[Shuffle](https://shuffler.io/docs/)**  
  Shuffle is a lightweight SOAR platform that allows for:  
  - Automation of incident response workflows.  
  - Integration with tools like Wazuh and The Hive for seamless response actions.  
  - Customizable workflows to streamline repetitive tasks, improving SOC efficiency.

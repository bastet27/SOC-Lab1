### :art: Workflow Diagram  

![SOC Automation Workflow Diagram](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/34633435-6771-4a34-b1c7-3db66769ac27)

### Step-by-Step Breakdown of the Workflow  

#### **üíñ Pink: Event Flow**  
- **üíñ Step 1: Send Events**  
  - **Windows 10 Client (Wazuh Agent)** sends event logs to the **Wazuh Manager** via the router. This step captures endpoint activity for analysis.  
- **üíñ Step 2: Receive Events**  
  - **Wazuh Manager** receives the event logs and analyzes them. It triggers alerts when predefined conditions, such as detecting specific threats, are met.  

#### **üü¶ Teal: Alert Transmission**  
- **üü¶ Step 3: Send Alerts**  
  - **Wazuh Manager** sends triggered alerts to **Shuffle** for further processing. This step transitions event data into actionable intelligence.  
- **üü¶ Step 5: Send Alerts to The Hive**  
  - Once enriched, **Shuffle** sends these alerts to **The Hive**, a case management system, for logging and tracking.  

#### **üíö Green: Enrich IoCs**  
- **üíö Step 4: Enrich IoCs**  
  - **Shuffle** enriches the alerts by performing Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) gathering. This enhances the understanding of Indicators of Compromise (IoCs), providing valuable context for incident response.  

#### **üß° Orange: SOC Analyst Notification**  
- **üß° Step 6: Send Email to SOC Analyst**  
  - **Shuffle** sends an email notification to the **SOC Analyst**, detailing the incident and prompting action.  
- **üß° Step 7: Send and Receive Email**  
  - The **SOC Analyst** reviews the email and responds by selecting a containment or remediation action based on the provided information.  

#### **üíô Blue: Response Action**  
- **üíô Step 8: Perform Response Action**  
  - The analyst‚Äôs response is sent back through **Shuffle**, which processes the response and forwards it to the **Wazuh Manager**. The **Wazuh Manager** then issues commands to the **Windows 10 Client** to execute the remediation action.
